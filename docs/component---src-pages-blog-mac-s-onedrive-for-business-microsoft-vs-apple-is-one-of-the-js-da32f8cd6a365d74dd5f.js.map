Something that reads like a Shakespeare play. Filled with ambition, idealism, jealousy, and plot twists.</p>\r\n                      <p>The smooth-talking Jobs vs awkward dancing nerd Gates. Their fierce competition started in the 70’s when personal PCs were just starting off.</p>\r\n                      <p>By the 90’s both companies had taken off and were known around the globe but the turbulence was ahead. Microsoft was being investigated by the FTC for abusing their monopoly while Apple had a fantastic computer that was performing poorly on the market due to lack of applications available.</p>\r\n                      <p>In a sudden plot twist, the two companies entered into a historic partnership where Microsoft purchased $150 million dollars of stock and promised to make the Microsoft Office suite available on Macs.</p>\r\n                      <p>Things soured in the 2000’s when the rivalry sparked back up with Job’s chastising Microsoft for “copying Google and Apple”.</p>\r\n                      <p>Today, times have changed. Both companies have steered in different directions. Apple focused on their device lines including the iPad and iPhone while Microsoft has transformed into a cloud computing company with Office 365 and Azure. Since the bitter rivalry has ended Microsoft has developed dozens of apps for the Mac and iPhone including OneDrive for Business.</p>\r\n                      <h2>What’s OneDrive for Business?</h2>\r\n                      <p>Mac and Apple fans, I’d like to introduce you to Microsoft’s OneDrive.
