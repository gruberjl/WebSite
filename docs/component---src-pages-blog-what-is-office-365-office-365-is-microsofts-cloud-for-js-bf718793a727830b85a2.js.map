Designed around productivity and collaboration, Microsoft has integrated over 30 apps into the cloud platform. From <strong>email, file storage, and secure chat for teams</strong>, businesses around the world are empowering their users by improving productivity while cutting costs. Microsoft’s continued shift to cloud computing has had a significant impact on businesses.</p>\r\n                  <p><strong>Exchange Online</strong> is Microsoft Office 365’s cloud-based email solution. The industry-leading cloud solution is the most common app adopted by small businesses and Fortune 500 companies. Microsoft Exchange Online provides the benefits of a cloud-based email service with the robust capabilities of an on-premises server deployment. Simple to manage and rock-solid security has made Exchange Online the top business email service in the cloud. SPAM filters, compliance, e-discovery, and archiving are integrated directly into the platform. Since every user can have a mailbox up to 50GB in size and send and receive emails as large as 150MB, organizations can stop managing mailboxes and start being more productive.</p>\r\n                  <p>Read the rest of the article at <a href=\"http://documentmedia.com/article-2792-What-Is-Office-365.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Document Media</a>.</p>\r\n                </Col>\r\n              </Row>\r\n            </Container>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </main>\r\n      </Page>\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default BlogArticle\r\n"],"names":["BlogArticle","render","title","jsonLd","headline","datePublished","keywords","url","jsonLdType","image","canonical","description","className","href","rel","React"],"sourceRoot":""}
