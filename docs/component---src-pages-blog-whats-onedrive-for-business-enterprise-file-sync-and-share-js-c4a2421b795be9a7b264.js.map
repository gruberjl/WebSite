By 2020 each person will own an average of 7 connected devices. Work computers, home laptops, smart phones, and tablets. The data we use must be accessible any time, any where, and on every device. The challenges of data accessibility don’t stop there. The data has to be available on Microsoft, Apple, and Android devices.</p>\r\n                <p>The traditional methods of data storage on personal devices and servers are falling short. Lost and stolen devices, server outages, and the inability to access data while on the road have all caused a loss of productivity, missed deadlines, and decrease the customer experience.</p>\r\n                <p>Employees expect fast, easy access to their files from the device of their choice. The sales team can review the quote in their car before the big meeting. Teams working and updating spreadsheets at the same time.
